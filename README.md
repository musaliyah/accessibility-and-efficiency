# accessibility-and-efficiency

Revising a source code so that the webpage is more accessible, and has a concise style-sheet that makes files more efficient and readable. 

Changes to the original code will ensure the web page is optimized for search engines that prioritize accessibility. 

In the process of editing the code <div> tags were replaced by semantic tags in order to make the code easier to read, and can function with assistive technology such as screen readers. Furthermore, image descriptions were also added so that user experience can be more equitable regardless of user's ability status.
